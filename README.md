# Modular-Trackular Plus (MT+)

Optional mods for the **Polyend Tracker+**, built into
[Polyend's Tracker Community Edition (CE)](https://github.com/polyend/tracker-ce) firmware.
It continues [Modular-Trackular](https://github.com/FatRodzianko/Modular-Trackular), which
patches stock firmware 1.2.0.

MT+ is unofficial and not affiliated with Polyend, who don't support these builds. Please
don't report problems with them to Polyend.

Everything CE does is here too. There is one firmware file, and each mod has its own
Off/On switch, so there's no separate build for each mix of mods.

## Mods

| Mod | What it does | Settings |
|---|---|---|
| **Humanize** | A Humanize button on page 3 of the Pattern screen's bottom bar gives the selected notes small random changes in the Micro-move (`m`) and Volume (`V`) columns. It works in edit mode, and Undo reverts it. | Project Settings → Humanize |
| **Global Swing** | Every take and pattern start uses the project's Swing amount (25–75). A Swing FX still works for the rest of its pattern. | Project Settings → Global Swing |
| **Color Song** | Song screen blocks get a colour from their content, so the same material is easy to follow through a song. Colours stay put and are saved with the project. | On/Off only |

All three are tested on hardware.

The chord inversions from the 1.2.0 mods are now part of CE itself. Still to port, with no
dates: conditional trigs, Copy to New, Variable Track Length, Legato, FX Interpolation,
Song Loop, the pad visualizer, slice Loop, Master FX, live resampling, and the WAVE and
PHASE synths. The plan is in [`docs/mt/CE_PORT_PLAN.md`](docs/mt/CE_PORT_PLAN.md).

## Turning mods on and off

- **Config → Mods** sets which mods are on in new projects.
- **Project Settings → Mods** sets which are on in the open project. The choice is saved
  with the project, so each project can have its own set.
- With a mod Off, its code doesn't run and that part of the firmware is CE's. One thing
  differs in every MT+ build, whichever mods are on: the mods get 1 MiB of sample memory,
  so the longest stereo recording is 5:50 instead of 5:56.
- A project that used these mods on 1.2.0 brings its Humanize, Global Swing and Color Song
  settings with it the first time it opens.

## Install

MT+ is for the Tracker+ only. The Original Tracker and Tracker Mini builds from this branch
have no mods.

1. **Back up your SD card's `Projects` folder.** CE saves patterns in a newer format that
   1.2.0 can't read. `tools/ce_to_120.py` makes a copy of a project that 1.2.0 can open,
   without the things only CE has.
2. **Get the firmware.** There are no releases yet. Either build it with `make plus` (see
   [Building Firmware](#building-firmware) below), which makes
   `build/TrackerPlus_MT_1.0.0.ptf`, or sign in to GitHub and download the
   `polyend-tracker-ce-firmware` artifact from a build of this branch under
   [Actions](https://github.com/FatRodzianko/Modular-Trackular-Plus/actions).
3. **Flash it** as in
   [Flashing on Hardware & Emergency Recovery](#4-flashing-on-hardware--emergency-recovery)
   below. Config then shows the version as `1.0.0 MT`.

## Development

- `modular`, this branch, holds the mods. `main` is an untouched copy of polyend/tracker-ce.
- The mods are in [`core/mods/`](core/mods), and changes to CE's own files are marked
  `// MT:`.
- Tests are in `core/mods/tests/` (on the computer) and `tools/emu/` (in an emulator).
- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) has the rules for adding code: what runs in the audio interrupt,
  the display limit and memory.
- [`docs/mt/CE_FIRMWARE_MAP.md`](docs/mt/CE_FIRMWARE_MAP.md) maps CE on the Tracker+.

## MT+ license

CE's [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) apply here, as in
[License](#license) below. They don't allow selling `.ptf` builds. The closed synth
libraries in `synth/lib/` have a license of their own.

*The rest of this page is CE's own README, unchanged. On this branch its build output is
named `TrackerPlus_MT_*.ptf` rather than `TrackerPlus_CE_*.ptf`.*

## Notice: Official Support, Warranty & Hardware Disclaimer

> **A Quick Note Before Flashing or Modifying Firmware**
>
> Thanks to the Tracker's isolated bootloader and hardware emergency recovery button (see [Flashing on Hardware & Emergency Recovery](#4-flashing-on-hardware--emergency-recovery)), experimenting with Community Edition builds is very safe. Even if a custom build fails to boot, you can easily re-flash a stable `.ptf` image from your microSD card. That said, we still need to include the standard legal disclaimer just in case:
>
> * **Provided "AS IS" Without Support Obligation**: While the foundation of this repository was originally developed and released by **Polyend**, the **Polyend Tracker Community Edition (CE)** firmware, source code, and any community-developed modifications or plugins are provided **"AS IS"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied. **Polyend has no obligation to provide official technical support, maintenance, bug fixes, or customer service** for Community Edition firmware or custom builds.
> * **Use at Your Own Risk**: Flashing, modifying, or running custom firmware is done at your own discretion and risk. Polyend is not liable for any data loss, project corruption, malfunction, or hardware damage (including "bricking" a device or issues caused by code modifications) arising from the use of this software.
> * **Out-of-Warranty Repairs Available**: In the unlikely event that something ever goes wrong with your hardware while using custom firmware, it is **not covered under standard warranty**. However, **Polyend is always happy to help get your instrument back up and running through its official out-of-warranty repair service** (standard service, parts, and shipping fees apply. See [How to Contact Polyend Customer Support](https://backstage.polyend.com/t/how-to-contact-the-polyend-customer-support/15510)).

## Building Firmware

### 1. Prerequisites
* **[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain `10.3-2021.10`](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm)**:
  * Direct official downloads from Arm:
    * **Linux (`x86_64`)**: [`gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2`](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2)
    * **Linux (`aarch64` / ARM64)**: [`gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-aarch64-linux.tar.bz2`](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-aarch64-linux.tar.bz2)
    * **macOS (`x86_64` / Apple Silicon via Rosetta)**: [`gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-mac.tar.bz2`](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-mac.tar.bz2)
    * **Windows (ZIP)**: [`gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-win32.zip`](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-win32.zip)
  * Ensure `arm-none-eabi-gcc` is on your `PATH`, extract the toolchain into `./agt/10.3/`, or pass `TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/arm-none-eabi-` to `make`.
* `make` (for building firmware) and `python3` (used by `make ptfx` to package `.ptfx` Sample Editor plugins and by the `make bump-*` version helpers; standard library only).

### 2. Build Commands
From the repository root:

```bash
# Build all three devices (Original Tracker, Tracker+, Tracker Mini)
make all

# Or build a single target:
make original   # -> build/PolyendTracker_CE_1.0.0.ptf
make plus       # -> build/TrackerPlus_CE_1.0.0.ptf
make mini       # -> build/TrackerMini_CE_1.0.0.ptf

# Build reference .ptfx Sample Editor effects into editor-fx-sdk/build/Effects/:
make ptfx

# Clean all build directories:
make clean
```

### 3. Version Management (`version.mk`)
All firmware version numbers are defined in [`version.mk`](version.mk). The **Build** identifier displayed on the hardware under **Config > Firmware > Build** is automatically populated from the short Git commit hash (`git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD`):

```bash
# Show current version, Git build hash & output filenames
make version

# Increment patch version (e.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
make bump-patch TARGET=all        # or TARGET=original | TARGET=plus | TARGET=mini

# Increment minor version (e.g. 1.0.x -> 1.1.0)
make bump-minor TARGET=all        # or TARGET=original | TARGET=plus | TARGET=mini
```

### 4. Flashing on Hardware & Emergency Recovery

1. Copy the generated `.ptf` file from `build/` (`PolyendTracker_*.ptf`, `TrackerPlus_*.ptf`, or `TrackerMini_*.ptf`) to the `/Firmware/` folder on your Tracker's microSD card.
   * *Note*: Keep `.ptf` filenames at **31 characters or fewer** so the Original Tracker's 32-byte `/Firmware/_fwinfo` bootloader buffer remains null-terminated.
2. On the device, open **Config > Firmware > Firmware update**, select the `.ptf` file, and confirm.

> **Bootloader Resilience & Emergency Firmware Recovery**:
> * The Polyend Tracker bootloader is isolated from the application firmware:
>   * On the **Original Tracker (`MK66`)**, the bootloader runs on a separate dedicated microcontroller (`kBootloaderTrig`).
>   * On **Tracker+ and Tracker Mini (`IMX`)**, the bootloader resides in a protected region at the bottom of QSPI Flash (`0x60000000`–`0x6002FFFF`), while `.ptf` application builds are linked starting at `0x60030000` (do not modify the flash `ORIGIN` address in the linker scripts).
> * **Emergency Recovery**: If a custom firmware build ever hangs or fails to boot into the UI, you can always recover your device:
>   1. Place a known-good, stable `.ptf` firmware file for your device inside the `/Firmware/` folder on your microSD card (ideally as the only `.ptf` file in `/Firmware/`).
>   2. Insert the microSD card into your Tracker and power it on.
>   3. Use a paperclip or SIM-eject pin to press the **recessed hardware Reset / Emergency Bootloader pinhole button** (located on the bottom of the Original Tracker / Tracker+, or next to the USB-C port on Tracker Mini). The hardware bootloader will automatically pick up the `.ptf` file from `/Firmware/` and flash it.
